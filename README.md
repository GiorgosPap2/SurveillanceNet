I developed a surveillance system as a project for the university course "Object-Oriented Programming." The system monitors the activity of a network of suspects for criminal acts by recording their communications, such as phone calls or messages. It then calculates a list of suggested potential partners for each suspect based on the "triangle closure" principle, which suggests that users in a social network tend to form friendships with friends of friends. Additionally, the system features a graphical user interface that allows the user to search for a suspect and view their information. This includes the suspect's details, a list of messages sent or received by the suspect containing the words "Bomb", "Attack", "Explosives", or "Gun", a list of the suspect's potential partners, and a list of the suspect's suggested potential partners. It also provides a visual representation of the network.

  The system we developed is a surveillance system for monitoring the activity of a network of suspects for criminal acts. The system records communications between suspects, either phone calls or messages. Then, the system calculates a list of suggested potential partners for each suspect. This list is based on the principle of "triangle closure", which states that users in a social network tend to form friendships with friends of friends.
  The system also has a graphical user interface that allows the user to search for a suspect and obtain information about them. The information that can be viewed includes the suspect's details, a list of messages sent or received by the suspect that contain the words "Bomb", "Attack", "Explosives", or "Gun", a list of the suspect's potential partners, and a list of the suspect's suggested potential partners.
